This paper aims to develop a tool for predicting accurate and timely traffic flow Information. Traffic
Environment involves everything that can affect the traffic flowing on the road, whether itâ€™s traffic
signals, accidents, rallies, even repairing of roads that can cause a jam. If we have prior information
which is very near approximate about all the above and many more daily life situations which can
affect traffic then, a driver or rider can make an informed decision. Also, it helps in the future of
autonomous vehicles. In the current decades, traffic data have been generating exponentially, and we
have moved towards the big data concepts for transportation. Available prediction methods for traffic
flow use some traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfactory to handle real-world applications.
This fact inspired us to work on the traffic flow forecast problem built on the traffic data and models.
It is cumbersome to forecast the traffic flow accurately because the data available for the
transportation system is insanely huge. In this work, we planned to use machine learning, genetic, soft
computing, and deep learning algorithms to analyse the big-data for the transportation system with
much-reduced complexity. Also, Image Processing algorithms are involved in traffic sign recognition,
which eventually helps for the right training of autonomous vehicles
